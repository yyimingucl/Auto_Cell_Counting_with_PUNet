# Automatic Cell Counting in Digital Pathology

This repository is the pytorch implementation of the work **Automatic Cell Counting in Digital Pathology** and provides some baseline deep learning models for segmentation-based cell counting. 

## Set up Environments 
### 1. Docker 

All the experiemnts are running within the deepo docker image which is an all-in-one solution for ML/DL development and supports GPU acceleration. (more details on https://hub.docker.com/r/ufoym/deepo/)

* Step 1 pull image with ''' docker pull ufoym/deepo '''

* Step 2 run image with '''docker run --runtime=nvidia -i -p 8888:8888 -p 6060:22 --ipc=host --name="[Your Container Name]" -v [The Folder you wanna bind mount with container]:/data ufoym/deepo:latest jupyter'''

* Step 3 install further required packages

  - tensorboard = 2.8.0
  - scikit-image = 0.19.2
  - scipy = 1.8.0
  - seaborn = 0.11.2
  - opencv-python = 4.5.5.64
  - tqdm = 4.63.1



### 2. Conda run '''conda env create --name [Your env name] -f env.yml'''
